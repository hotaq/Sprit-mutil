# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Workflow Toolkit

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-agent-toolkit`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Project Vision To provide a robust, command-line-based toolkit that allows a human supervisor to manage multiple AI coding agents working on a single software repository. The system must prevent chaos by providing each agent with an isolated workspace (git worktree) while enabling centralized supervision through a shared terminal session (tmux). The goal is to make parallel AI-driven development observable, manageable, and efficient.

Core Features & Requirements
Automated Setup: The toolkit must be installable in any git repository with a single command (uvx ... init), which bootstraps the entire environment, including configuration files, scripts, and environment variables.

Configuration-Driven Agents: The number, names, and branches of agents must be defined in a simple, human-readable YAML file (agents/agents.yaml). The toolkit must be able to provision and de-provision agent workspaces based on this file.

Session Management: The supervisor must be able to start, attach to, and terminate the shared tmux supervision session using simple commands (sprite start, sprite attach, sprite kill).

Agent Communication: The toolkit must provide a mechanism for sending instructions from the supervisor to the agents. This includes broadcasting a command to all agents (sprite send) and sending a specific message to a single agent (sprite hey).

Context-Aware Synchronization: A core requirement is a \"smart sync\" command (sprite sync) that behaves differently based on the context, as defined in the Agent Sync Workflow Guide.

When run in the main worktree, it pulls changes from the remote origin/main.

When run in an agent's worktree, it merges the local main branch.

Workspace Navigation: The supervisor needs efficient tools to navigate between agent workspaces (sprite warp) and focus on a single agent's pane by zooming in (sprite zoom).

Extensible Layouts: The tmux session must support multiple pre-configured visual layouts (e.g., side-by-side, top-and-bottom) and allow for user-defined custom profiles.

User Roles
Alex (The Supervisor): A developer or project lead who orchestrates the AI agents. Alex is responsible for defining tasks, monitoring progress, resolving conflicts, and integrating the agents' work.

User Stories
As Alex, I want to run a single command to initialize the toolkit in my project, so that I can get a multi-agent environment running in under a minute.

As Alex, I want to define my team of three agents in a simple YAML file, so that I can configure their branches and roles before starting work.

As Alex, I want to start a tmux session that shows all my agents in separate panes, so that I can have a real-time \"mission control\" view of all their activities.

As Alex, I want to send the task \"implement user authentication\" to Agent 1, so that I can delegate a specific feature to a dedicated agent.

As Alex, I want to broadcast the git status command to all agents simultaneously, so that I can get a quick overview of the entire project's state.

As Alex, I want to run sprite sync in the main pane to pull the latest remote changes, and then run sprite sync in each agent's pane to merge those updates, so that all agents are working with the latest code.

As Alex, I want to remove Agent 3's worktree and branch after their task is complete, so that I can keep the repository clean and tidy.

Non-Functional Requirements
Dependencies: The toolkit requires git v2.5+, tmux v3.2+, yq, and uvx to be installed on the host system.

Usability: All core interactions must be exposed through a simple and memorable command-line interface (sprite).

Isolation: An agent's file system operations must be strictly contained within its designated worktree to prevent accidental interference with other agents.

Observability: The supervisor must be able to see the complete command history (stdin and stdout) for every agent within the tmux session."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Environment Setup (Priority: P1)

As Alex, I want to run a single command to initialize the toolkit in my project, so that I can get a multi-agent environment running in under a minute.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for the entire workflow - without quick setup, users won't adopt the tool. A fast, painless setup experience is critical for user adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the initialization command in an empty git repository and verifying that all necessary files, configurations, and directory structures are created within 60 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing git repository, **When** Alex runs the initialization command, **Then** the toolkit creates the agents directory structure, example configuration file, and installs necessary scripts within 60 seconds
2. **Given** no git repository exists, **When** Alex runs the initialization command, **Then** the system provides clear error message with instructions to initialize git first

---

### User Story 2 - Agent Configuration Management (Priority: P1)

As Alex, I want to define my team of three agents in a simple YAML file, so that I can configure their branches and roles before starting work.

**Why this priority**: Configuration-driven setup is essential for reproducibility and easy management. Without proper configuration, managing multiple agents would be error-prone and difficult to scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a YAML configuration file with multiple agents and verifying that the system correctly parses and creates the corresponding git worktrees and branches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid YAML configuration with three agents, **When** Alex applies the configuration, **Then** the system creates three separate git worktrees with correct branch names
2. **Given** an invalid YAML configuration, **When** Alex applies the configuration, **Then** the system provides clear validation errors with line numbers and suggested fixes

---

### User Story 3 - Mission Control Session (Priority: P1)

As Alex, I want to start a tmux session that shows all my agents in separate panes, so that I can have a real-time "mission control" view of all their activities.

**Why this priority**: Real-time observability is the core value proposition - supervisors need to see what agents are doing as it happens to provide guidance and catch issues early.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the tmux session and verifying that each agent has its own pane, that all panes are visible simultaneously, and that the session persists correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** configured agents exist, **When** Alex starts the supervision session, **Then** tmux launches with separate panes for each agent plus a supervisor control pane
2. **Given** an active supervision session, **When** Alex detaches and reattaches, **Then** all panes maintain their state and continue running commands

---

### User Story 4 - Individual Agent Communication (Priority: P2)

As Alex, I want to send the task "implement user authentication" to Agent 1, so that I can delegate a specific feature to a dedicated agent.

**Why this priority**: Individual communication enables targeted task assignment and efficient resource utilization. This allows supervisors to leverage the strengths of different agents for specific tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a command to a specific agent and verifying that only that agent receives and executes the command while others remain unaffected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active supervision session, **When** Alex sends a command to Agent 1, **Then** only Agent 1's pane displays and executes the command
2. **Given** an invalid agent name, **When** Alex sends a command, **Then** the system provides a clear error with available agent names

---

### User Story 5 - Broadcast Communication (Priority: P2)

As Alex, I want to broadcast the git status command to all agents simultaneously, so that I can get a quick overview of the entire project's state.

**Why this priority**: Broadcast commands enable efficient coordination and status checks across all agents, saving time compared to sending commands individually.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by broadcasting a command and verifying that all agents receive and execute the command simultaneously, with their outputs visible in their respective panes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active supervision session with multiple agents, **When** Alex broadcasts a command, **Then** all agents execute the command and display results in their panes
2. **Given** one agent is unresponsive, **When** Alex broadcasts a command, **Then** other agents still execute and the system indicates which agent(s) didn't respond

---

### User Story 6 - Smart Synchronization (Priority: P1)

As Alex, I want to run sprite sync in the main pane to pull the latest remote changes, and then run sprite sync in each agent's pane to merge those updates, so that all agents are working with the latest code.

**Why this priority**: Synchronization prevents conflicts and ensures all agents work with consistent code. This is critical for maintaining project integrity in a parallel development environment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making changes in one agent, syncing to main, then syncing other agents and verifying they receive the updates correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Alex is in the main worktree, **When** Alex runs sync, **Then** the system pulls latest changes from remote origin/main
2. **Given** Alex is in an agent's worktree, **When** Alex runs sync, **Then** the system merges local main branch into the agent's current branch
3. **Given** merge conflicts exist, **When** Alex runs sync, **Then** the system provides clear instructions for resolution

---

### User Story 7 - Workspace Cleanup (Priority: P3)

As Alex, I want to remove Agent 3's worktree and branch after their task is complete, so that I can keep the repository clean and tidy.

**Why this priority**: Cleanup functionality prevents repository bloat and maintains project organization. While not critical for initial functionality, it's important for long-term maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by removing an agent's workspace and verifying that the worktree, branch, and any agent-specific files are properly cleaned up.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent has completed their work, **When** Alex removes the agent, **Then** the system removes the worktree, branch, and updates configuration
2. **Given** an agent has uncommitted changes, **When** Alex attempts removal, **Then** the system warns about potential data loss and requires confirmation

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Agent Process Crashes**: System detects unresponsive agents and provides clear error messages with manual recovery guidance
- **Network Interruptions**: Git operations fail gracefully with suggestions to check network connectivity and retry manually
- **Disk Space Issues**: Early detection with clear warnings about insufficient space before operations start
- **Concurrent File Access**: Git worktree isolation prevents conflicts, with clear error messages if boundary violations occur
- **Tmux Session Termination**: Session recovery guidance provided, with options to reconnect or create new sessions
- **General Failure Strategy**: All errors follow graceful degradation approach with actionable recovery steps

- **Tmux Session**: Shared terminal session providing real-time observability and control over all agent activities (AI agents run as external processes in their assigned panes)
- **Supervisor Control Interface**: Performance command-line interface (Rust/Go) with shell scripts for git/tmux integration that enables session management and agent communication
- **Synchronization Context**: Current worktree state that determines sync behavior (pull from remote vs merge from main)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: Agent Configuration Structure - How should agents be identified in the YAML configuration? → A: Numbered agents (1, 2, 3) with optional name/description fields
- Q: AI Model Integration - How should the toolkit interface with AI models? → A: External AI processes - toolkit manages workspaces/terminals, user connects AI tools separately
