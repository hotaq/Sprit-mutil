# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Agent Workflow Toolkit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [Multi-Agent Workflow Toolkit](../spec.md)
**Status**: âœ… VALIDATION PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All items passed** - Specification is ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user story coverage with independent test scenarios
- Clear, measurable success criteria aligned with user needs
- Well-defined functional requirements with testable acceptance criteria
- Proper scope bounding and dependency identification
- Technology-agnostic focus on user value

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
