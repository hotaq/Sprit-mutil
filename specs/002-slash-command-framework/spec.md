**Feature Branch**: `002-slash-command-framework`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "now i have mutilagent system that build on rust but we not have somthing like CLAUDE.md for project or slash command for cluade code not just only CLAUDE.md other framwork i need to like codex droid or other , in CLAUDE.md it just like tell agent that you it orchestor for sofeware development , short cut keywordlike , cac for summarize context and save to github issue . how about slash command slash command it's main feature just like it gonna tell bot how to use commnad in sprite just like /hey bot it's gonna use tool from sprite and send text to other bot"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Leverage Existing Speckit Framework (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the multi-agent system, I want to extend the existing `/speckit.*` command ecosystem (speckit.specify, speckit.plan, speckit.implement, etc.) with new agent communication commands so that I can build on the proven Claude Code slash command infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: The speckit framework already provides the foundation - building on it delivers immediate value while maintaining consistency with existing tooling. No need to reinvent the command processing system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new command file alongside existing speckit commands and verifying it integrates seamlessly with the current workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have existing speckit commands in `.claude/commands/`, **When** I add a new agent communication command, **Then** it appears alongside `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, etc. in the command interface
2. **Given** I want to create a new shortcut like "cac", **When** I add it to the command system, **Then** it follows the same patterns as existing speckit commands for consistency
3. **Given** I execute a new custom slash command, **When** it runs, **Then** it has access to the same project context and infrastructure that existing speckit commands use

---

### User Story 2 - Multi-Agent Communication Commands (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to add agent-to-agent communication commands like `/hey bot [message]` to the existing speckit framework so that I can coordinate workflows between multiple AI agents using familiar slash command syntax.

**Why this priority**: Agent communication is the core missing piece in the current speckit ecosystem and directly addresses the "send text to other bot" requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing a `/hey` command that forwards messages between agents and verifying message delivery works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple agents configured, **When** I use `/hey target-agent [message]`, **Then** the message is delivered to the specified agent with full context preserved
2. **Given** I want to broadcast to all agents, **When** I use a broadcast command, **Then** all relevant agents receive the message simultaneously
3. **Given** an agent receives a message through a slash command, **When** it processes the message, **Then** it can respond using the same command interface

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Framework Integration Support (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want the slash command system to work with different AI frameworks (Claude Code, Codex, Droid, etc.) so that I can use slash commands regardless of which AI assistant or framework I'm working with.

**Why this priority**: The core requirement is framework-agnostic operation. Users need commands to work across their entire development ecosystem, not be locked to one framework.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring commands for different frameworks and verifying they execute correctly in each environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have configured Claude Code framework settings, **When** I execute a slash command, **Then** it routes through Claude Code's command processing system
2. **Given** I have configured Codex framework settings, **When** I execute the same slash command, **Then** it adapts to Codex's command format and executes successfully
3. **Given** I switch between frameworks, **When** I use slash commands, **Then** the system automatically translates commands to the appropriate format for the active framework

---

### User Story 4 - Command Context Management (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want slash commands to have access to and modify shared context so that commands can operate meaningfully with the current project state and conversation history.

**Why this priority**: Context awareness is what separates useful commands from simplistic scripts. Commands need project awareness to provide real value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up project context, running context-aware commands, and verifying the output reflects the current state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an active project with files and conversation history, **When** I run a context-aware command like "/cac", **Then** the command has access to the current project context and can summarize it appropriately
2. **Given** I run a command that generates output, **When** the command completes, **Then** relevant output is added to the shared context for future commands to reference
3. **Given** I run multiple commands in sequence, **When** each command executes, **Then** it can reference the results and context modifications from previous commands

---

### User Story 5 - Shortcut Keyword System (Priority: P2)

As a power user, I want to define shortcut keywords like "cac" for complex command sequences so that I can execute frequent workflows with minimal typing.

**Why this priority**: This directly addresses the requirement for "shortcut keyword like cac" and significantly improves user productivity for common operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by defining shortcut aliases and verifying they expand to full command sequences when invoked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have defined a shortcut keyword, **When** I type the shortcut, **Then** it expands to the full command sequence and executes
2. **Given** I want to create a new shortcut, **When** I use the shortcut registration command, **Then** I can map a keyword to any command sequence or action
3. **Given** I have multiple shortcuts defined, **When** I type partial shortcuts, **Then** the system provides auto-completion suggestions for available shortcuts

---

### User Story 6 - Template Initialization System (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to run `sprite init` to automatically install CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, and work_structure.md templates along with agent folder structure so that I can quickly set up a new multi-agent project with proper configuration files.

**Why this priority**: This is the core onboarding experience - users need templates and structure ready to go without manual setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `sprite init` in an empty directory and verifying all template files and folder structure are created correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I run `sprite init` in an empty directory, **When** the command completes, **Then** CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, and work_structure.md templates are copied to the project root
2. **Given** templates are installed, **When** I check the project structure, **Then** an `agents/` folder is created with example agent configuration structure
3. **Given** I have template files installed, **When** I customize them for my specific needs, **Then** agents can read and follow the defined structure and rules

---

### User Story 7 - Agent Configuration Structure (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to create agent-specific configurations in `agents/[agent-name]/` folders with their own CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md files so that different agents can have specialized behaviors and capabilities.

**Why this priority**: This enables true multi-agent customization where each agent can have unique roles and skills while following project-wide standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an agent folder with custom configs and verifying agents load and use the correct agent-specific files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create an agent folder `agents/my-agent/`, **When** I add CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md files, **Then** the agent loads and uses these agent-specific configurations
2. **Given** I have multiple agents with different configurations, **When** agents run, **Then** each agent follows its own rules while respecting the work_structure.md framework
3. **Given** I update an agent's configuration files, **When** the agent restarts, **Then** it picks up the new configuration changes without affecting other agents

---

### User Story 8 - Work Structure Framework (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want work_structure.md to define how agents should organize and process their work so that all agents follow consistent patterns and can coordinate effectively.

**Why this priority**: This provides the architectural foundation for agent behavior and coordination, ensuring all agents work in a predictable and structured way.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a work_structure.md file and verifying agents read and follow the defined patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a work_structure.md file, **When** an agent starts up, **Then** it reads and applies the structural rules defined in the file
2. **Given** multiple agents are running, **When** they process work, **Then** all agents follow the same structural patterns from work_structure.md
3. **Given** I update work_structure.md, **When** agents restart, **Then** they apply the updated structure consistently across all agent types

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a slash command is invoked but no agents are available or responsive?
- How does the system handle conflicting command registrations (same name, different actions)?
- What happens when a command requires more context than is currently available?
- How does the system handle malformed or incomplete slash command syntax?
- What happens when an agent-to-agent communication fails due to network issues or agent unavailability?
- How does the system handle circular command dependencies (Command A calls Command B which calls Command A)?
- What happens when shortcut keywords conflict with actual command names?
- What happens when `sprite init` fails to create templates due to permission issues or missing template files?
- How does the system handle conflicting agent configurations (same setting defined in both project-level and agent-specific files)?
- What happens when an agent's configuration files contain syntax errors in CLAUDE.md or SKILL.md?
