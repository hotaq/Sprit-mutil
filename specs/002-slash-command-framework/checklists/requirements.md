# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Agent System Slash Command Framework (Updated)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [Multi-Agent System Slash Command Framework](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
- [ ] Existing speckit framework integration is clearly defined

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Updated specification focuses on extending existing speckit framework without mentioning specific implementation details
- ✅ **User value focused**: All requirements are framed in terms of leveraging existing infrastructure for immediate user benefit
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for business and product stakeholders with clear references to existing speckit commands
- ✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria are fully populated with speckit integration context

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ **No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers**: All requirements clearly reference existing speckit framework and extension approach
- ✅ **Testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-015) now references speckit integration points
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria updated to reflect extending existing infrastructure rather than building new systems
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user experience while leveraging existing Claude Code slash command foundation
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story includes integration with existing speckit commands and workflows
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: Updated to reflect conflicts between new commands and existing speckit commands
- ✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Specification focuses on extending speckit framework rather than creating new command infrastructure
- ✅ **Dependencies identified**: Clear dependency on existing `.claude/commands/` infrastructure and speckit patterns

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each user story shows integration with existing speckit commands
- ✅ **Primary user flows covered**: Extending speckit framework, agent communication, multi-framework support, and context management with existing tools
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Success criteria measure extension of existing infrastructure performance rather than new system creation
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains focus on extending speckit rather than implementation details
- ✅ **Existing speckit framework integration clearly defined**: All user stories and requirements reference extending `/speckit.*` commands

## Updated Assessment Notes

### Key Improvements Made:
- **Speckit Framework Integration**: Added User Story 1 focusing on leveraging existing `/speckit.*` command ecosystem
- **Agent Communication Focus**: Created dedicated User Story 2 for agent-to-agent communication commands
- **Infrastructure Alignment**: Updated all functional requirements to reference existing speckit patterns and `.claude/commands/` structure
- **Entity Definitions**: Revised Key Entities to include Speckit Command Framework, Agent Communication Commands, and Claude Code Integration
- **Success Criteria Alignment**: All criteria now measure extending existing infrastructure rather than building new systems

## Overall Status: ✅ PASSED

The updated specification successfully leverages existing Claude Code slash command infrastructure and speckit framework while maintaining all quality criteria. Ready for planning phase (/speckit.plan).

## Notes

- Specification now properly reflects building on existing speckit foundation rather than creating from scratch
- All validation items passed with single revision to incorporate existing infrastructure
- Integration approach ensures consistency with current speckit commands and workflows
- Ready to proceed to implementation planning with clear extension strategy
