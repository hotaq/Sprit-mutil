# Example Cargo configuration for GitHub Packages
# Copy this file to .cargo/config.toml in your project or home directory

[registries.github]
index = "sparse+https://github.com/hotaq/Sprit-mutil.git/registry/index/"

# Alternative format (also works):
# [registry.github]
# index = "sparse+https://github.com/hotaq/Sprit-mutil.git/registry/index/"

# For private repositories, you might need:
# [source.crates-io]
# replace-with = "github"

# [source.github]
# registry = "https://github.com/hotaq/Sprit-mutil.git/registry/index/"
