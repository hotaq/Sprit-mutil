- [ ] Check semantic annotations
- [ ] Validate enhanced descriptions

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] Test with `NO_COLOR=1`
- [ ] Verify color independence
- [ ] Check high contrast mode
- [ ] Validate text alternatives

#### Motor Testing
- [ ] Test keyboard-only operation
- [ ] Verify consistent command structure
- [ ] Check for time-limited interactions
- [ ] Validate error recovery

## Command Accessibility

### All Commands Support:
- `--help` with clear descriptions
- Consistent parameter ordering
- Progress indicators for long operations
